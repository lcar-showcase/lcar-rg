# Onboarding Template
Getting Started Project with React and Typescript

## New repository setup
1. Use this template to create a new repository in GitHub
1. Follow the naming convention stated below and use the initials of the newbie (ensure the repo name is in lowercase and hyphenated)
1. In the new repository, add branch protection rules for the `master` branch to enforce PRs and approvals for merging code to `master`
1. Ensure the supervisor/mentor has the `admin` role, and you have the `maintainer` role in the new repository. This can be achieved by assigning roles to a GitHub team.
   - Add `@onboarding/supervisors` team as admin
   - Add the team with the newbie that you're onboarding as maintainer

### Game development
1. Once the game has been chosen, rename this repository following one of the convention below:

   | Game         | Repository name |
   |--------------|-----------------|
   | Battleship   | `battleship-xx` |
   | Congkak      | `congkak-xx`    |
   | Connect 4    | `connect4-xx`   |
   | Reversi      | `reversi-xx`    |
   | _Undecided*_ | `onboarding-xx` |

\* Change repo name to one of the following once the game has been decided.
